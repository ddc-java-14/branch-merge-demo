# Branch Management

## Group Projects

No multi-person project can do without task and issue branches. The only possible exception is in a 2-person project, where *all* changes are made in a pair-programming mode, and *all* changes are committed & pushed immediately.

## Creating Branches

Branch management begins with creating an appropriately named branch. Note that that branch will be checked out: always note that you are working in the correct branch afterwards.

See ["Merging"](merging.md) for best practices on merging branches.
