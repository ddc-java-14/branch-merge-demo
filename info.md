# Branch Management

## Group Projects

No multi-person project can do without task and issue branches. The only possible exception is in a 2-person project, where *all* changes are made in a pair-programming mode, and *all* changes are committed & pushed immediately.

## Creating Branches

Branch management begins with creating an appropriately named branch.
